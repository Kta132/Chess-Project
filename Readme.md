## Background

This is why this application exists.

The point for this application is so that I can try and have fun in trying to create a chess game with coding. It would be nice to customize the difficulty and try to create chess puzzles to solve, even if I might already know the answers to the puzzle since I placed them, but it would be interesting to see and learn how to code better.
