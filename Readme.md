## Background

This is why this application exists.

The point for this application is so that I can try and have fun in trying to create a chess game with coding. It would be nice to customize the difficulty and try to create chess puzzles to solve, even if I might already know the answers to the puzzle since I placed them, but it would be interesting to see and learn how to code better.

## Install
These are the steps to setup your local environment to run this application.

To use this application, you would only need to have the link and run the program.

## Usage

These are the steps to use the application or interact with it.

So far, there isn't much to do on this program besides watch the program draw the chess board but I'm planning on adding the pieces to it if I can.
